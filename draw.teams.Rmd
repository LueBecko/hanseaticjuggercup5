## Registration Information from the JTR

Just loading the JTR-registration information for the tournament.

The data is given as a CSV-file. Teams are ordered by registration date and receive an id number accordingly. Additionally the data set contains the column FIX, which indicates if a team is set as a participant and not part of the random draw process - those teams are home-teams from LÃ¼beck. All none FIX teams are part of the random draw.

```{r load}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)

registration <- read_csv("registration.csv", 
                         col_types = cols(FIX = col_logical()))

knitr::kable(registration)
```

3 teams are set FIX, 17 teams are participating, 14 teams will be drawn and 2 will be kicked out from the set (you can reenscribe to the list to participate in the usual succession scheme).

## Random draw - participation

And now fo the random draw. A seed is set for reproducability. A new column is added (IN), which indicates if a team is participating in the tournament.

```{r draw}
set.seed(2019)

teams.in <- sample(x = (registration %>% filter(!FIX))$Position,
                   size = 14,
                   replace = FALSE)

registration$IN <- registration$FIX
registration$IN[teams.in] <- TRUE

knitr::kable(registration %>% filter(IN))

knitr::kable(registration %>% filter(!IN))
```

Above you see the list of participants according to the random draw and the teams that did not pass the draw. I hope this does not cause any hard feelings - just reenlist for the succession procedure if you still want to participate.
